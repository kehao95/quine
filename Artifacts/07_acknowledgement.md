# Acknowledgments

First and foremost, I am deeply indebted to my wife, Jingyun Wu, for her unwavering support and infinite patience during my prolonged periods of researcher mania. Without her understanding—and her diligence in ensuring I remained biologically sustained—this project would likely have terminated prematurely due to resource exhaustion.

As an independent researcher, I also acknowledge the assistance of AI collaborators that served as my virtual laboratory: Google Gemini for primary brainstorming and conceptual structuring; ChatGPT for acting as a ruthless critic and red-teaming my axioms; and Anthropic Claude for serving as a tireless coding assistant. All final conceptual syntheses, architectural decisions, and errors remain my own.
